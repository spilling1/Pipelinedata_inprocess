Absolutely — let’s level this up! Below is a **significantly more detailed PRD** for each page. These are designed to guide an AI agent or junior dev clearly, covering **functional requirements**, **component breakdown**, **data needs**, **insight logic**, **file structure**, and **implementation notes**.

# 🌟 **1️⃣ Executive Summary — Detailed PRD**

## 🎯 **Objective**

Provide users with an immediate snapshot of marketing performance, key results, and top-level guidance on next steps.

## 📌 **Key Features**

### Metrics Summary (top row)

* **Total Pipeline:** Sum of pipeline values across all campaigns
* **Total Closed Won:** Sum of closed won values across all campaigns
* **Average ROI:** Weighted average ROI (Closed Won / Cost \* 100) across all campaigns
* **Average Win Rate:** Weighted average win rate across all campaigns

### Time Series Chart

* Line chart showing cumulative:

  * Pipeline value over time
  * Closed won value over time

### Insight Cards

* **Best Performing Campaign Type:** Highest ROI campaign type with % and name
* **Most Inefficient Campaign Type:** Type with lowest ROI and > X% of budget spend
* **Best Pipeline Efficiency:** Campaign type or individual campaign with best Pipeline/Cost ratio

### Callout Box

* Short text summary:

  * “Webinars have delivered the highest ROI at 3410%. Consider reducing investment in Events (773% ROI).”

---

## 📊 **Component Breakdown**

* `<ExecutiveSummaryMetrics />` → Metric boxes
* `<PipelineOverTimeChart />` → Line chart
* `<ExecutiveInsights />` → Insight cards + callout box

---

## 🛠 **Data Requirements**

* Aggregated data:

  * Sum pipeline, closed won, cost per campaign type & campaign
  * Time-bucketed pipeline + closed won values (weekly or monthly)
  * ROI calculations: (Closed Won / Cost \* 100)

---

## 🧠 **Insight Logic**

* Best performing = max(ROI by type)
* Most inefficient = min(ROI by type) where cost > (10% of total cost)
* Pipeline efficiency = max(Pipeline / Cost)

---

## ⚙ **File Structure**

```
/analytics-comparison/ExecutiveSummary.tsx  
/analytics-comparison/hooks/useExecutiveSummaryData.ts  
/analytics-comparison/components/ExecutiveSummaryMetrics.tsx  
/analytics-comparison/components/PipelineOverTimeChart.tsx  
/analytics-comparison/components/ExecutiveInsights.tsx  
```

---

## ⚡ **Implementation Notes**

✅ Chart lib: Reuse existing (e.g. Recharts / Chart.js)
✅ Use date-fns for time grouping
✅ All insight text should be generated via helper in `utils.ts`

# 🌟 **2️⃣ Campaign Type Performance — Detailed PRD**

## 🎯 **Objective**

Compare performance of campaign types, identify strengths, inefficiencies, and budget reallocation opportunities.

* ROI %
* Win Rate %
* Pipeline / Cost
* Customer count

* Suggested reallocation (from worst type → best type)

---

## 📊 **Component Breakdown**

* `<CampaignTypeROIBarchart />`
* `<CampaignTypePerformanceTable />`
* `<CampaignTypeInsights />`

---

## 🛠 **Data Requirements**

* Group campaigns by type
* Aggregate: cost, pipeline, closed won, opp count, customer count
* Derived:

  * ROI = (closed won / cost \* 100)
  * Pipeline / cost

---

## 🧠 **Insight Logic**

* Same as Executive, scoped to type
* Reallocation: if worst ROI type cost > 10% → recommend reallocation

---

## ⚙ **File Structure**

```
/analytics-comparison/CampaignTypePerformance.tsx  
/analytics-comparison/hooks/useCampaignTypeData.ts  
/analytics-comparison/components/CampaignTypeROIBarchart.tsx  
/analytics-comparison/components/CampaignTypePerformanceTable.tsx  
/analytics-comparison/components/CampaignTypeInsights.tsx  
```

---

## ⚡ **Implementation Notes**

✅ Use existing bar chart styles
✅ Add hover tooltips on bars (show cost, win rate, pipeline/cost)

---
